            <p>Hello! My name is Pratyusha Chamarthi, and I am currently a second-year student majoring in Data Science and Business Administration. I have a strong passion for technology, web development, and creative problem-solving, and I love finding ways to merge business insights with data-driven decision-making. My academic journey has allowed me to explore a variety of topics, from data visualization to statistical analysis and front-end development. I enjoy applying these skills to build interactive websites and data-focused projects that solve real-world challenges.

                Beyond academics, I have a wide range of interests that help balance my creative and analytical sides. I love baking and often experiment with new recipes, especially matcha-based desserts. In my free time, you can also find me thrifting for unique pieces, exploring new restaurants around the city, and grabbing a good matcha latte. Staying active is important to me, and I enjoy playing tennis with friends whenever possible.
                
                I am passionate about constantly learning new things and stepping outside my comfort zone. Whether itâ€™s working on a new coding project, collaborating on team initiatives, or attending local tech meetups, I am always seeking opportunities to grow. Thank you for visiting my website and learning a bit more about me!</p>
